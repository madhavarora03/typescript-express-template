# Typescript Express Backend Template File

> Typescript + Eslint + Prettier

Every time you create a project, you have to configure various tools. This will be a waste of our time. We will do this with a template to solve this problem. Congratulations on finding the project template you want.

## How use this template with your project?

Click above `Use this template` button to create a new repository with these configurations. Then, clone into your project repository, and run the dollowing commands

```bash
git clone <your-github-repo>
cd <your-project-directory>
npm install
```

## Development Mode

It restarts target node process when any of required files changes

```bash
npm run dev
```
## Preview Production Build


## Typescript

[What is TypeScript and why would I use it in place of JavaScript?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/12694530/what-is-typescript-and-why-would-i-use-it-in-place-of-javascript/35048303#35048303)

- Support for modern JavaScript features
- Advanced type system
- Developer tooling support
- Optionally static typing and type inference
- Enhanced IDE support
- Strict null checks
- JavaScript interoperability

## Eslint

[ESLint](https://eslint.org/) is a tool for identifying and reporting on patterns found in ECMAScript/JavaScript code, with the goal of making code more consistent and avoiding bugs. ... ESLint uses an AST to evaluate patterns in code. ESLint is completely pluggable, every single rule is a plugin and you can add more at runtime.

## Prettier

Prettier is an opinionated code formatter with support for:

- JavaScript (including experimental features)
- JSX
- Angular
- Vue
- TypeScript
- CSS, Less, and SCSS
- HTML
- JSON
- GraphQL
- Markdown, including GFM and MDX
- YAML

## Ts-node

[ts-node](https://typestrong.org/ts-node/docs/) is a TypeScript execution engine and REPL for Node.js.

It JIT transforms TypeScript into JavaScript, enabling you to directly execute TypeScript on Node.js without precompiling. This is accomplished by hooking node's module loading APIs, enabling it to be used seamlessly alongside other Node.js tools and libraries.

- Automatic sourcemaps in stack traces
- Automatic tsconfig.json parsing
- Automatic defaults to match your node version
- Typechecking (optional)
- REPL
- Write standalone scripts
- Native ESM loader
- Use third-party transpilers
- Use custom transformers
- Integrate with test runners, debuggers, and CLI tools
- Compatible with pre-compilation for production
